# Paperframe Client

## Credits

This includes a _ton_ of strategy and code from David Eisinger's
[dce/e-paper-frame](https://github.com/dce/e-paper-frame), author of one of the
[tutorials](https://www.viget.com/articles/making-an-email-powered-e-paper-picture-frame/)
I used for the RPi/display portion of the Paperframe project. Many thanks for
sharing and clearly documenting!
